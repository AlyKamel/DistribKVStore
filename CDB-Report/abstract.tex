In today's world communication is key between people to retrieve information that is substantial. Almost every software system includes a messaging platform nowadays in order to ease their clients lives by offering a chat service where essential information can be shared. On this basis we extended our program with a group chat feature, where multiple clients can communicate with each other via chatrooms.\\
This report begins with a brief description of the replicated and distributed storage service from milestone 4. The replication strategy guarantees eventual consistency and basic availability, which is crucial for distributed database systems.\\
Furthermore, our extension is examined focusing firstly on how the system works from the clientâ€™s point of view. Following that the features of the group chat and the implementation is studied in greater detail. The main idea is that multiple clients can join a chatroom with a chatID, assigned individually for every different room, and exchange messages there. Moreover, clients can perform read and write operations with the help of a chatbot while being in the chatroom. \\
Eventually we conclude our paper with a performance analysis by comparing results from our performance measurement tests and touch upon the advantages of providing a group chat.
