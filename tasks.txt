CURRENT
- multiple users creating same chatroom at same time

NOT WORKING
- log files
- issue with getallkeys (directory deleted)
- check writelocks, serverstopped etc

NEEDS TESTING
- replication starting data transfer with 3 servers

MAIN IDEA: Group chat
- QUIT CHAT: >leaving chatroom
- password protection
- user limit
- public/private chatrooms
- chatroom/chat users levels (different read/write pri
- chatbot that does gets/puts, acts as a client

OTHER IDEAS
2) Transactions
- atomic

3) Undo
- UNDO 3: undos the last three PUT/DELETE operations
- REDO 

4) Expiration
- PUTEXP mykey myvalue 10: mykey gets deleted after 10 secs
- TTL mykey: time to live
- PUTLIM mykey myvalue 10: mykey gets deleted after 10 reads

5) Read-only
- PUTRO mykey myvalue: myvalue cannot be changed or deleted by another client
- PUTPW mykey myvalue mypass
- GET mykey myvalue: >mykey is password-protected. Please enter the password:

6) Pattern matching
- GETM 89*: gets all keys which match 89*

7) Store txt file to databse
- PUT filepath: PUT filename filedata
