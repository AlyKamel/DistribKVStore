\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

After consideration of the benefits and weaknesses of the implementation we come to this conclusion.

We highly recommend our extension only for lightweighted communication. 

Firstly, because it might occur that the chatrooms are not equally distributed throughout the system and thereby just one server might have to carry the load of having all the chatrooms. 

That is why we had to set a limitation regarding the number of chatrooms per server to 15 and clients per chatroom to 30. If the user of our group chat prefers to work on a large-scaled messaging platform and can give up on having low latency, the limitations for the number of chatrooms and the clients could be increased.

Secondly, the chat only allows words as messages. Nowadays it is standard to be able to send emojis, pictures, stickers, videos, files, weblinks etc. which is not featured by us. This means that people in general will prefer a more powerful chatroom software since we do not offer these extras.

On the other hand we have an extra that these other softwares do not provide. We can access the DB via the ChatBot and therefore use together with chatroom in one combined application. And since the typical use case wants the chat to be about the data of the DB we consider this a big advantage.

Thinking about the implementation the ChatBot is obviously a bottleneck. Imagine there is a full chat room with 30 users. If they now start doing their own DOPs (for instance updating their weekly report) all operations are executed by one ChatBot. The workload of 30 sockets are pressed into one. This leads to a significant efficiency loss.

That is why our second important recommendation for the extension is that heavy modification and updates of the DB must be done outside of chat rooms, in order to make full use of the clients individual socket capacities.

All in all we believe our extension improved our DB in a significant way, though we know that our chatroom features has a lot of room for enhancement.
