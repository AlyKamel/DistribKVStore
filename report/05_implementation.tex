\section{Implementation}

In this section the implementation of the chatroom is examined in depth. Firstly, the extension for the client side and then for the server side are described respectively. Lastly the Chat system is explained in greater detail, since it encapsulates our work for milestone 5.

\subsection{Client Side Implementation}
\label{sec:Implementation_clintside}

\end{figure}

The client side consists of three following main components as seen in the figure above:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item ClientApp\\
   The ClientApp represents the client interface which allows input through the console. From there the client is able to issue commands to: connect to and disconnect from the system, interact with the key-value store and chat. The input is then checked and parsed before getting sent to the ClientLibrary.
  \item ClientLibrary\\
The ClientLibrary serves as a bridge between the client and the server.
  \item ActiveConnection\\
  ActiveConnection abstracts the TCP socket connection to the server which allows the client to connect to the server socket and exchange data without worrying about the underlying structure.
\end{enumerate}
 
\subsection{Server Side Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation_serverside}

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

Each server owns a list containing the active chatrooms that it is responsible for. In order for a client to join one of those chatrooms is that it would first need to connect to that server, similar to the way storing key-value pair functions. The decision, to make chatrooms accessible only from one server has both its advantages and disadvantages. For one, it reduces the complexity of the system because otherwise servers would need a way to exchange updates regarding the active chatrooms and chat users whenever a user joins or leaves.

A problem with our implementation is that if the chatIDs are not equally distributed across all servers, which may occur due to the unpredictable nature of the hashing function, a single server could then be in charge of most chatrooms. This would cause that a server to be overloaded with requests and would lead to greater response times and, in the worst case scenario, would result in a bottleneck for the whole system. In order to combat this issue, we limit the amount of chatrooms belonging to one server to 15 and the amount of users in a single chatroom to 30. This means a server is responsible for up to 450 chat users. These limits could also be easily changed depending on the intended use case of the system.

The biggest advantage of our decision is that it heavily reduces network traffic. Since all chatroom users are connected to the same server, that server can easily forward messages between them. Otherwise additional socket connections would have been required which would have both increased the load on the network and the overall complexity of the system.

Our idea for the chatting functionality was for it to be as lightweight as possible with clients entering and leaving chatrooms regularly.

\subsection{Chat System}
\label{sec:implementation_chatsystem}
The Chat system consists of three following main components as seen in Figure 2, namely:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ChatManager\\
	TODO
	\item Chatroom\\
	TODO
	\item ChatBot\\
	TODO
\end{enumerate}
