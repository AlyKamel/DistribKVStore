In today's world communication is the key between people to retrieve information they need. Almost every software system includes a messaging platform nowadays in order to ease their users life by offering them a chatting space where essential information can be distributed.\\
In this paper we will initially describe our replicated and distributed storage service from milestone 4. Completing milestone 4, we developed a service where multiple clients can put, get or delete data records with the help of replicated and distributed storage servers. The architecture that the storage servers are situated is a ring topology comprised of one server as a coordinator node and following two nodes as replicas. The replication strategy guarantees eventual consistency, which is crucial for distributed database systems. The logic behind eventual consistency is to provide consistent value for a specific data item among all the nodes, given enough time without any updates. Furthermore, implemented strategy ensures increased availability since key-value pairs are distributed over three nodes preventing a performance bottleneck.\\
Following that we will examine our extension, Milestone 5, which is based on a group chat system and study the features of the group chat in greater detail. The main idea is that multiple clients can join a chatroom with a specific chatID by their userIDâ€™s and exchange messages in the chatroom. Moreover, clients can perform get requests while chatting and every group has a limit for their number of clients.\\
Eventually we conclude our paper with highlighting the most important features of our extension and touch upon the significance of the outcomes using a group chat.
